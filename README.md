# Lexer_and_Parser

Developed a lexical analyzer for precise tokenization of code (variables, numbers, operators) and implemented a recursive descent parser to evaluate arithmetic expressions, conditionals, and loops. Ensured correct operator precedence, parenthesis handling, and nested expression resolution through AST generation.
